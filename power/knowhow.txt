1- S/C/P state
2- driver

1. S/C/P state
 1) C state
 *  view method
 # cpupower info
 # turbostat
 # grep . /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpuidle/state*/*
 * setting method
 - BIOS
 - grub parameters
   idle=poll,
   intel_idle.max_cstate=N,
   processor.max_cstate=N
 - cpupower idle-set
 - echo  1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuN/cpuidle/stateN/disable

 2) P state
 * governor
  - performance
  - powersave
  - ondemand
  - userspace
  - conservative

 * instructions of governor
  # cpupower frequency-info
   available cpufreq governors: performance powersave
  # grep . /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policyN/*

 * set method
  # cpupower frequency-set -g performance
  # echo powersave > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policyN/scaling_governor

2. driver
 * idle driver
  -intel_idle driver
   add "processor.max_cstate=0" to grub
  - acpi_idle driver
   add "intel_idle.max_ctstate=0" to grub
 
 * freq driver
  intel_pstate supported governor
  - powersave
  - performance

  acpi_freq supported governor
  - powersave
  - performance
  - ondemade
