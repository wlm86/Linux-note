1. BIOS + MBR  the schema of present pc's arch
 - BIOS :	Base input output system
 - MBR	:	Master Boot Record (master boot sector)
 - MSDOS:	the disk partion mode of BIOS+MBR
		suppot the 2TB at the most
		4 primary | (3 primary + 1 extended) & countless logic

  tool  :  fdisk
2. EFI + GPT 
 - EFI	:	extensible Firmware Interface
 - GPT	:	GUID Partion Table
		support 18EB(1024PB=1048576TB)
		partion count has no limit

  tool  :  sgdisk

2. SAS and SATA

    https://www.pickaweb.co.uk/kb/difference-between-sata-sas-hard-drives/
  1) SATA stands for Serial Advanced Technology Attachment 
     and SAS stands for Serial Attached SCSI 
     (SCSI Stands for Small Computer System Interface, typically pronounced as scuzzy).
     They are two types of interface used for transferring data to and from hard drives.
  2) speed
     SATA:	7.2K
     SAS :	10K and 15K 


7. ide/scsi/virtio
IDE - Slow Write in the Guest System 

SCSI - Faster Write(as IDE) in Guest System  

VIRTIO - Fastest Write (more that SCSI and IDE) in the Guest System, but only with extra Drivers (In Guest)
