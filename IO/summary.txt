1. base concept

  1) sector	(logical_block_size)
    - basic unit for hardware trasferring the data
    - generally 512 Byte
      # cat /sys/block/sda/queue/logical_block_size
      512
    - is the smallest size the drive is able to write 
      (cf. the linux kernel documentation).
    - can displayed by parted or fdisk
      Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes <-/ 4096 bytes
 
  2) block	(physical_block_size)
    - basic unit for VFS and file system
    - most generally block size is 4KB = 8 sectors
    - generally 512/1024/2048/4096 Byte 
      # cat /sys/block/sda/queue/physical_block_size
      4096
    - is the minimal size of a block the drive is able to write 
      in an atomic operation.
    - can displayed by parted or fdisk
      Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes <-
    - get the block size
     # blockdev --getbsz /dev/sda*
    - Create filesystem to change new block size
     # mkfs -t ext4 -b 2048 /dev/sde1
     # mount /dev/sde1 /FIO
     # blockdev --getbsz /dev/sde1
       2048
  3) inode
    - generally 1file <-> 1 inode. multi mapping when ln
    - used by store the file metadata 
    - stat command cat get inode NO. infomation
    - "df -i" cat get used inodes can free
    - "dumpe2fs -h /dev/sde1"  get fs information
    - "ls -i /etc" cat get inode NO.
    - when file include special character, you can delete inode.
      # find ./ -inum 69239404 -exec rm -irf {} \;
   

  3) segment
  4) page cache
     
  5) Direct I/O <-> Buffer IO
    - Direct I/O generally requires data to be aligned on disk sector 
      boundaries.(multiple 512Byte)
    - O_DIRECT open()
    - mmap and direct_IO to the same file at the same time may result in 
      fail with I/O error.

2. tuning
  - tune IO

3- e2fsprogs
  1) badblocks
     #  badblocks -b 4096 -c 3 /dev/vda3 -o bbs.txt
        -b  4096B as a block
        -c  check 3times every block
        -o  output text file
     #  badblocks -b 4096 -c 3 /dev/vda3 -o bbs.txt  666 555
        check from 555 -> 666 blocks
