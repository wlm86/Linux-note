 ^HIGH ADDRESS
 | 1) stack (zhan) area
 |   - managed by compiler, the compiler automatically assign and release 
 |     the memory.
 |   - store some parameters which was used to run function
 |     * local variables
 |     * function parameters
 |     * return parameter
 |     * return address  etc.
 | 2) heap (dui) area
 |   - managed by programer. 
 |    * malloc etc.
 |
 | 3) static area (Uninitialized data segment & Initialized data segment)
 |   - managed by system. it was reclaimed automatically 
 |     after programer was closed
 |    * uninitialized gloable/static variables 
 |      it's BSS segment. Block Started by Symbol
 |    * initialized gloable/static variables
 |       it's data segment
 |
 | 4) text constant area (text segment and code segment)
 |   - managed by system. It was reclaimed automatically 
 |     after programer was closed.
 |    * string constant value "123456" etc.
 |    * code segment
