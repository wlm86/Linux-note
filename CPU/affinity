 1) Each processor core has its own L1 and L2 caches.  They aren't shared.
 2) The L3 cache is shared among all processor cores on the same processor socket.
 3) Nothing is shared not even back-end RAM between processor cores on different processor sockets.
 4) there's multiple different network interfaces, and each is local to a specific NUMA node.
