  - io Engine
  1) libaio		asynchronous IO
  2) sync		synchronous IO	

  - direct (default: 0)
  1) 0			buffer IO
  2) 1			driect IO (without pagecache)
2.
 1) when test buffer
  - in order to avoid data instability need to clean memory buffer by "sync"
   # sync
   # echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches 
  
  - the filesize need to less than `cat /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio` * `free memory`
