1) the difference between ps's cpu usage and top's usage 
  - ps (the life time of process, average usage)
  CPU usage is currently expressed as the percentage of time spent
       running during the entire lifetime of a process. This is not ideal,
       and it does not conform to the standards that ps otherwise conforms to.
       CPU usage is unlikely to add up to exactly 100%.
  - top (instant)
  The task's share of the elapsed CPU time since the last  screen
          update, expressed as a percentage of total CPU time.
